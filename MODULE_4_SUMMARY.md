# ADS 509 Module 4: Political Naive Bayes - Assignment Summary

## Assignment Completion Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive political text classification system using Naive Bayes for ADS 509 Module 4. The assignment demonstrates both exploratory analysis and practical classification applications.

## Implementation Details

### Part 1: Exploratory Naive Bayes ✅
- **Database Connection**: Successfully connected to `2020_Conventions.db`
- **Data Processing**: Implemented robust text preprocessing pipeline
  - URL removal, mention/hashtag cleaning
  - Stopword removal and tokenization
  - Case normalization and punctuation handling
- **Feature Engineering**: Word frequency filtering (cutoff = 5) to reduce noise
- **Model Training**: Naive Bayes classifier with train/test split
- **Feature Analysis**: Detailed examination of most informative features
- **Performance Evaluation**: Accuracy metrics on convention speech classification

### Part 2: Congressional Tweet Classification ✅
- **Database Connection**: Successfully connected to `congressional_data.db`
- **Data Extraction**: Complex SQL query joining candidate and tweet data
- **Cross-Domain Application**: Applied convention-trained model to tweets
- **Sample Analysis**: Detailed classification of individual tweets with confidence scores
- **Large-Scale Evaluation**: Confusion matrix analysis on 10,000+ tweets
- **Performance Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1 scores for both parties

## Key Features Implemented

### Technical Implementation
1. **Text Preprocessing Functions**
   - `clean_tokenize()`: Comprehensive text cleaning for political content
   - Handles social media specific elements (URLs, mentions, hashtags)
   - NLTK integration for tokenization and stopword removal

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - `conv_features()`: Converts text to feature dictionaries
   - Frequency-based feature selection to improve performance
   - Boolean feature representation for Naive Bayes

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**
   - Train/test split with reproducible random seeds
   - NLTK Naive Bayes classifier implementation
   - Comprehensive performance analysis

4. **Database Integration**
   - SQLite connectivity for both databases
   - Error handling and connection verification
   - Efficient data processing for large datasets

### Analysis & Insights
1. **Political Language Patterns**
   - Identification of partisan vocabulary differences
   - Analysis of most informative features
   - Temporal and contextual language variations

2. **Cross-Domain Challenges**
   - Convention speeches vs. social media text
   - Formal vs. informal language patterns
   - 2020 training data vs. 2018 test data

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Detailed confusion matrix evaluation
   - Precision/recall analysis by party
   - F1 score calculations and interpretation
